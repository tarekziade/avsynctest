AV Sync and dropped frames test
===============================

- a video displays a text with the frame number and a sine wave sound which
  frequency is synchronized with the frames
- the test runs the video inside firefox and records the screen
- the recorded video is analysed to verify that
  - we've displayed all frames
  - the sound stayed synchronized
