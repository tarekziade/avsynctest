AV Sync and dropped frames test
===============================

- a video displays a moving dot and plays beeps
- the test runs the video inside firefox and records the screen
- the recorded video is analysed to verify that
  - we've displayed all frames, by looking at the dot position
  - the sound stayed synchronized by looking at its position
